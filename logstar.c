/*The function 
log∗, pronounced "log star", is defined as being the number of times that
you can take the logarithm of its argument before getting a value less than one. 
For example, using base two logs, log∗10=3 because log2 10 = 3.322 (one application); 
log2 3.322 = 1.732 (second application) and log2 1.732 = 0.792 (third application, now less than one).*/
